# Algorithms1
An algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character and then proceeds to count the length of the sentence (the number of characters),
the number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space), the number of vowels in the sentence.


NOTE: 
Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
